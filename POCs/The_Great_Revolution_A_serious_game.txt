The Great Revolution: A serious game to support the teaching of the Industrial Revolution in history disciplines.

With digital inclusion, more and more people are starting to use electronic games as a means of entertainment. This platform can be used in several different ways, including as a teaching method, blending entertainment and content, so that students can learn content interactively and also develop other skills depending on the game style. But there is great complexity in creating educational games, such as defining the content to be taught, the gameplay that will be used, the technologies that will be involved, the game quality assessment process, among other important points. Therefore, it is fundamental to analyze several factors to start a project that aims to teach content through games. This work shows the entire process that was carried out to create the scope, development, and evaluation of a serious game, called The Great Revolution, with the objective of teaching about the Industrial Revolution. For this, game development tools were used, such as Tiled and Unity, as well as some patterns to develop scripts for creating the game's story. An evaluation method was also applied to measure the quality of the game. The developed game was applied in high school classes at Campus UFV Florestal and was evaluated using the MEEGA+ Method and the Likert scale, through a form for students to evaluate the game and its characteristics. In this way, we obtained a rate of 83.64% positive responses and 10.30% negative responses. In general, we had very satisfactory results and were able to cover the entire flow of creating a game to be used in learning specific content, from the creation of the game's story, to its development and application in classes. We also had as a result, the creation of a flowchart for a better understanding of the game development process, which can be used as a basis to facilitate the creation of other projects.
