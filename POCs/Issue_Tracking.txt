Impact of Thematic Relevance and Other Communication-Related Attributes in Issue Tracking on Issue Resolution Time
In a software development project, issue resolution can be influenced by several factors, such as the number of developers involved, issue complexity, developer experience, multitasking, and polite comments. Thus, understanding which factors influence its resolution time is crucial for reducing it and, consequently, for project outcomes. Objective: This work aims to evaluate the impact of attributes extracted from GitHub issue tracking repositories on issue resolution time. These attributes encompass the thematic relevance of posted comments, the number of comments and developers on an issue, and the participation of top-devs, whether in the creation, discussion, or resolution of issues. Materials and Methods: The Ruby on Rails organization was the subject of this study, due to its high activity in issue tracking. From the obtained data, Spearman's correlation method was applied to quantify the relationship between two attributes, and hypothesis tests were used to analyze the samples. Results: The results show that issues and pull requests created by top-devs have a shorter average resolution time. Furthermore, a trend of increased resolution time was found for issues and pull requests, and for issues alone, respectively, when the number of comments and developers increases. Finally, it was observed that the thematic relevance of comments generally shows low values, mostly between 0 and 0.1.
