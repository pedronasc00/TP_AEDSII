A Sticker Album integrated with Instagram as a Strategy to Encourage Participation in the myMobiConf System
Participatory sensing networks (PSNs) are systems in which the nodes sending data are people with mobile devices. These systems often suffer from a lack of user engagement. myMobiConf is an example of an event support RSP that uses a gamification approach to try to reduce this lack of engagement. Looking at successful RSPs such as the social network Instagram, and the strong presence of sticker albums in Brazilian culture, this work albums in Brazilian culture, this work proposes the implementation of a sticker album integrated into Instagram, as an addition to the application's gamification approach. The implementation of the sticker album during events proved to be effective in increasing participant engagement, resulting in more frequent returns to the app throughout the event.
