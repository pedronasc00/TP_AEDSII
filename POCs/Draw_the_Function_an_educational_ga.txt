Draw the Function: an educational game to aid the learning of mathematical functions

Educational games are an attractive way of teaching among most young high school or college students, although it's still not much explored by teachers of schools and/or universities. Many times those students fail to finish their course due to a lack of interest in classes, especially in the area of exact sciences, as most of them consider such disciplines difficult. Therefore, this work presents the development, analysis, and tests of the game Draw the Function, an educational game for teaching in the area of exact sciences, specifically mathematical functions. During the tests, we observed that Draw the Function has a pedagogical capacity, helping in the teaching of mathematical functions, as well as being an attractive and motivating game for its players.
