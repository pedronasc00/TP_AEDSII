"Thematic Relevance of Comments and Gender Diversity in Open Source Projects

This work analyzes female participation in terms of the thematic relevance of comments posted in the GitHub issue tracking environment. The study also investigates whether there are relationships between thematic relevance and other developer-related metrics, such as reputation, platform time, and the number of issues reported. Data from 5 open open-source communities and 5 dedicated to women were analyzed. The results indicate that, on average, the relevance of comments made by women is similar to that of men, showing them to be equally capable, but they demonstrate very low representation and participation, with only 22% of comments posted and 16% of issues reported."
