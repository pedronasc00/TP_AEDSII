A Multicast Protocol for Visible Light Communication (VLC)
Currently, the demand for Wireless Internet resources has grown exponentially. However, the wireless communication technologies available today may not be enough to keep up with the growing demand for bandwidth. In this context, Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a valid and promising alternative, given the high data transfer rate, the use of a lighting infrastructure already widely disseminated today, in addition to a wide spectrum available and not reserved for use. Therefore, this work aims to present an implementation of the multicast network protocol for visible light communication.
