Identification of drought-resistant and productive Eucalyptus crosses using leaf images
This work used a NasNetMobile convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify productive and drought-resistant Eucalyptus crosses based on leaf analysis. The dataset consisted of 17,790 images, after data augmentation, and was divided into 4 classes. The final test was divided into 3 stages. Stage I tested the number of dense layers, stage II dropout and L2 regularization and stage III k-fold cross-validation with k = 10. For cross-validation the best model achieved an accuracy of 82.69% in training, 63.96% in validation and 56.70% with the test images.
