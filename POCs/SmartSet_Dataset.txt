SmartSet: A Dataset of Smart Contracts from the Polygon Blockchain
Blockchain networks have been gaining popularity in recent years. With the arrival of smart contracts and the Ethereum network, several sidechains, such as the Polygon network, are being used as alternatives for low transaction costs and speed gains in block mining. Because of this, several studies are emerging to ensure that existing smart contracts in Blockchain networks
are free of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we develop a dataset of smart contracts written in the Solidity language, taken directly from the Polygon network. As a result, we obtained a total sample of 156,250 contracts, of which 4,708 are verified by the network and 151,542 are unverified. Furthermore, we extracted these contracts during 1.2 days, which can serve as a basis for analysis and creation of models that can improve the search for vulnerabilities and facilitate the development of secure smart contracts.
