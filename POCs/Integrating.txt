Integrating an App Installation Propensity Solution into a Corporate Big Data Infrastructure
The process of integrating a solution into an existing cloud infrastructure requires some important steps to achieve functional and efficient synergy. There are necessary adaptations that permeate at different levels, ranging from changes in implementation details of the initial solution to integration into the infrastructure itself. When there is a characterization of Big Data, the use of cloud services ends up being a strong facilitator of aggregation of the system of interest. This is because both service demand issues and quality issues are addressed, which ends up facilitating the process of creating a cohesive and effective infrastructure. In this paper, a mobile application installation recommendation solution was adapted to consider segments, and deployed in an organizational Big Data environment of a data intelligence company. As a result, it was possible to apply the solution to more than 1 million users and verify the probability of installing each segment for each user.
