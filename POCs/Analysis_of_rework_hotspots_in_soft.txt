Analysis of rework hotspots in software repositories: a study in GitHub projects

The present work performs a joint analysis of data in issue tracking and version control environments. The objective is to identify possible rework hotspots in software projects, in two categories of issues: those that have associated code and those that, although they involved many discussions, did not converge to code. Data was extracted from projects stored on the GitHub platform. For this, statistical analyses such as: correlation; multiple regression and hypothesis testing were applied. The analyses were performed on data related to the following parameters: number of commits, number of comments, number of developers and number of reopens. These parameters were analyzed jointly, to verify what influences existed between them. The results obtained showed that the selected parameters can have a strong relationship with rework hotspots in the two categories of issues evaluated.
