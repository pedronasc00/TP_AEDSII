ASTSecurer Vulnerability Detection Tool for Smart Contracts
As we move towards new decentralized application solutions, we can observe a growing number of smart contracts on blockchain networks, ranging from more straightforward implementations to more complex and valuable ones. However, this significant increase brings along a concerning amount of vulnerable contracts, susceptible to attacks from malicious actors aiming to steal resources or cause application failures. This paper aims to provide documentation on detecting the main vulnerabilities in Solidity and present an automated detection solution that utilizes static analysis techniques to identify vulnerabilities in large datasets of smart contracts. Based on this, performance tests and comparisons were conducted with the leading current tools in the smart contract verification field, In these experiments, our tool achieved good results in terms of both execution time and detection capability compared to the others.
