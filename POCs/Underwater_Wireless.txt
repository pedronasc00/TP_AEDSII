Underwater Wireless Optical Communication: Performance Characterization of Red Light
Underwater wireless information transfer is of great interest to the military, industry, and the scientific community, as it plays an important role, for example, in tactical surveillance, aquatic pollution monitoring, and offshore oilfield control and maintenance. Underwater wireless communications can be carried out through acoustic, radio frequency (RF), and optical waves. Underwater optical wireless communications (UOWCs) can support higher data rates with low latency than their bandwidth-limited acoustic and RF counterparts. However, aquatic channel conditions (e.g., absorption, scattering, turbulence, etc.) pose significant challenges for UOWCs and significantly reduce the attainable communication ranges, which demands efficient networking solutions. In this sense, this article investigates the performance of underwater visible light communication (UVLC), a subgroup of UOWC, using a transmitter in the red light spectrum in shallow and clear water. We evaluated the impact on transmission performance caused by light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) at this wavelength. The results show the impact on communication caused by the environment, the distance between nodes, and the type of transmitter used.
