Evaluating New Algorithms for the Analysis and Planning Modules of the Autonomic Sensor Element.
Wireless Sensor Networks are used in various contexts, which can include monitoring climatic aspects in a remote region, actuators for geographical and spatial events, in addition to applications in military or medical fields. However, this specific type of network has a limited energy capacity, and this directly impacts its processing capability and the amount of available memory. Faced with this limitation scenario, a generic model was developed that seeks to use the network's computational resources in a more balanced manner, with autonomic computing concepts that make the network self-configurable. In this work, we developed instances based on the generic model to improve the network's performance and prolong its lifespan. We implemented two more sophisticated algorithms and analyzed their behavior in experiments executed on real sensor networks, better known as testbeds. The results show that the implementations maintain or improve important aspects such as the number of messages sent and the amount of packets trafficked through the network
