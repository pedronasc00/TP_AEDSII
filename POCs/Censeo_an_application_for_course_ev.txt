Censeo: an application for course evaluation through a participatory sensing network

A much debated issue in educational institutions is how to evaluate the teaching-learning process. Traditionally, assessments are carried out using forms applied at the end of each school term. This work proposes a continuous assessment, class by class, from a network of participatory sensing, with the objective of generating more detailed metrics for the faculty. With this objective, the Censeo application was created, carrying out a case study with the use of it by three classes of a higher course. At the end of this, a system evaluation form was applied and the results demonstrated the effectiveness and capacity of this participatory sensing network in generating data and analysis in the context of student evaluation of teaching.
