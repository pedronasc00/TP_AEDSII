Toward Nanometric Scale Integration: An Automatic Routing Approach for NML Circuits

In recent years, many technologies have been studied as replacements or complements to CMOS. These emerging technologies, known as Field Coupled Nanotechnologies, aim to operate at nanometric scales and overcome problems difficult or impossible for CMOS technology to address. However, these new technologies introduce the need to develop tools for circuit mapping, placement, and routing. NanoMagnetic Logic Circuit (NML) is one such emergent technology, relying on the polarization of nanomagnets to perform operations through majority logic. This work proposes an approach to automatically map a gate-level circuit to an NML layout. The Breadth First Search algorithm is used for placement, and the A* algorithm is used to traverse the circuit and build routes for each node. To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, a series of ISCASâ€™85 benchmarks are utilized. The results show an area reduction varying from 20% to 60%.
