An Indoor Localization and Navigation Solution for the MyMobiConf System
Currently, several technologies that utilize GPS (Global Positioning System) as a localization solution are available for various application fields. However, the accuracy of these technologies can vary significantly, especially inside buildings where numerous satellite signal blockages can occur. Alternative approaches for these scenarios that achieve good results typically utilize additional infrastructure to improve accuracy. The approach in this work, however, uses only the components integrated into smartphones to provide a viable navigation system for an event participation support application, myMobiConf. The implemented proposal proved efficient for a wide range of buildings and, therefore, various types of events. It also utilizes sensor fusion to compensate for the inherent errors in inertial navigation systems.
