2GCMA: An Automatic Causal Model Generator Based on an Evolutionary Algorithm
Although association is a powerful tool for business, it does not always indicate causality. For this reason, this area has been the subject of significant study and research in recent years. As a consequence, new challenges have emerged. Among these is the automated generation of causal models, a crucial part of causality studies. While tools exist that attempt to meet this demand, they do not perform well in cases involving a large number of variables. Therefore, this work proposes an efficient solution based on an evolutionary algorithm to suggest causal models, designed primarily for cases involving a large number of parameters. The solution was evaluated on a dataset with 14,000 entries and 63 dimensions. The results showed that it was possible to create a relevant causal model using the evolutionary algorithm approach, whereas two tools from the literature failed to achieve satisfactory results. For future work, the intention is to improve the tool proposed in this paper to increase its precision and effectiveness in discovering causal effects.
