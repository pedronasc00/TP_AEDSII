Strategy Pattern applied to the generation of multiple data views in the ColMinerRT library

The use of design patterns allows developers to apply widely tested strategies in a specific domain. This work uses the Strategy pattern to improve the maintainability and extensibility of the ColMinerRT library's architecture, which aims to import data from the GitHub tool, calculate thematic relevance, and persist it in a CSV format file. The pattern was applied to create a new mechanism for generating data to be exported, including a new presentation layer that provides multiple structured views of the data. After applying the pattern, it was possible to observe gains in terms of maintainability and extensibility, as the code became more organized and more decoupled, allowing new views to be added in the future.
