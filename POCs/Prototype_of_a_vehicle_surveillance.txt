Prototype of a vehicle surveillance and access control system using computer vision.

Until a few decades ago, motor vehicles were not accessible to most of the Brazilian population, but today they are a reality in many people's homes. They are products targeted for theft, and are also used to commit them. With this increasing number of vehicles in circulation, and their use for theft, there has also been an interest in monitoring these vehicles, whether for traffic control, vehicle management in parking lots, capturing offenders, and other activities. With this in mind, this work proposes the development of an algorithm capable of recognizing vehicle license plates in images (photos) and videos, and extracting their characters, allowing data analysis. The objective is that from the results of this work, it will be possible to develop a real application capable of controlling vehicle flow, such as a garage, parking lot, or surveillance system. For this, the YOLO model was used for the convolutional neural network, trained with a dataset and applied to videos made in real traffic. The results show a model capable of locating license plates with 90% accuracy and an extraction of license plate characters with 50% success
