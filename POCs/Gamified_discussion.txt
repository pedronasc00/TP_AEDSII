A gamified discussion forum for UFV Virtual Labs to improve student interaction and engagement
This work presents the development of a discussion forum for the UFV Virtual Labs, a Virtual Laboratories platform to support the teaching-learning process that can be used in the presential or remote context. In environments of this type, there needs to be some functionality that promotes communication between teachers and students. Thus, discussion forums have proven to be very effective for this, in addition they allow students to share their knowledge with each other, in order to enrich the themes with different ideas and experiences. However, for a forum to provide these benefits, it is necessary for students to interact more effectively in it. Thus, to improve student interaction and engagement, a gamified reputation system was implemented with a distribution of points according to the type of student interaction in the forum. Finally, to evaluate the forum, a user test was carried out, in which 6 people, members
of the UFV Virtual Labs team, participated in a discussion about the reputation system and the toolâ€™s usability. As a result, in the view of the users (testers), the forum was considered an intuitive and easy-to-use functionality, however, there was a difficulty in understanding how the score update works when interacting in the forum, since this does not happen automatically . In addition, through the result of the ranking generated in the proof of concept, it was possible to visualize that the participants who interacted the most, mainly with each other, and with the shortest response time were in the highest positions.
