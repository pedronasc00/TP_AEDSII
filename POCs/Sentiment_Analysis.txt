Social networks are increasingly important means of communication, especially in an electoral period. This paper uses this context to perform a study of videos from the YouTube platform in the electoral period. Aspect-level sentiment analysis techniques are applied, using the pre-trained BERTimbau model, by extracting the transcripts and using the main candidates as target entities. It was possible to identify trends in behavior and positioning, in individual videos or channels. Overall, the analysis pointed to a greater presence of candidate Bolsonaro in the YouTube (53.2%), mainly in journalistic channels. The evaluation of the candidatesâ€™ channels show their approaches and strategies, mostly with mentions of the channel owner. The results also pointed to a trend of neutral manifestations, mainly in news channels, and a large impact of volume of quotes and interactions in Podcasts.
