Multiclass Semantic Segmentation of Bovine Carcasses
Due to the industry's growing competitiveness and the increasing demand for high-quality meat, the use of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Convolutional Neural Networks on the production line has become indispensable. This is particularly true in the context of extracting features for bovine carcass evaluation, such as the delineation of primal cuts. This study aims to implement a neural network capable of performing semantic segmentation of the bovine carcass, delineating it into three (3) classes of interest: Forequarter, Rib, and Hindquarter. Through the development of this technique, the carcass measurement process becomes much more efficient, considerably reducing time on the slaughter line and the number of interruptions. Furthermore, it reduces professional contact with the carcass, which leads to a lower risk of contamination and lends more reliability to the process. The primary metric used in the study was Cross-Entropy Loss, for which the trained model achieved a score of 11% on the validation set. This represents a satisfactory result, especially considering the dataset consisted of only 88 images, with 72 for training and 16 for validation.
