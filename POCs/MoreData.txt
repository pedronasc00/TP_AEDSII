MoreData+: Semantic Enrichment for Large Volumes of Geolocated Data
The MoreData tool aims to facilitate the work of geospatial data analysts by simplifying semantic enrichment processes that are often performed manually. It was not prepared to handle a large volume of data efficiently, especially concerning execution time. This paper introduces a new approach to MoreData's data model, incorporating the GeoPandas and DaskGeoPandas libraries. A quantitative analysis of execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage was performed for the new approaches. As a result, it was possible to significantly decrease the data enrichment execution time and enable the use of MoreData for large volumes of data.
