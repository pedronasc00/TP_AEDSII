Projeto de Validac¸ao do Simulador MANNASim ˜
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been explored to be used in
the Internet of Things (IoT). There are three basic strategies to evaluate WSN
solutions: analytical analysis, simulation and real experimentation. The first
one requires less cost, but is less precise. The last one, on the other hand, represents the real network, but requires a huge amount of investment. Therefore,
simulation is the most adopted strategy in the literature. Among the existing simulators, MANNASim is one of the most adopted. However, MANNASim has not
been validated so far. Thus, the objective of this work is to validate the MANNASim simulator by comparing its results with real ones. With the conclusion of
this work, it is expected that MANNASim can continue to be a constant target of
