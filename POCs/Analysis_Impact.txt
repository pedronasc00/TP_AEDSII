An Analysis of the Impact of Teaching and Outreach Initiatives on Learning Programming in a Computer Science Curriculum
This work analyzes the impact of teaching and extension initiatives in the Computer Science course, at the UFV Florestal campus, on student performance in subjects related to programming. Given the considerable level of dropouts and failures in subjects involving programming, initiatives were created to help in the development of students, one of which involves gamification, and the other, an extension project, to welcome freshmen, however, with a focus on the female public. The analyzes of the work took into account the comparison between the results of participating and non-participating students in the initiatives, also discussing participation in the pandemic period. It was observed that the initiatives help students in their performance, becoming interesting approaches to be applied in other courses in the IT area and in other institutions.
