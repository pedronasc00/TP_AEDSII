Applying a Gamification Approach to a Mobile Participatory Sensing Application.
Participatory Sensing Networks (PSN) suffer from a lack of active user participation, sometimes resulting in low data collection, which can directly interfere with the quality of their analyses. To mitigate this problem, this work applies a gamification approach as an intrinsic incentive mechanism to improve and make the use of a PSN application for event support more enjoyable. This application was created by the "Center for Studies in Pervasive and Distributed Systems" (NesPED) at the Federal University of Vi√ßosa, Florestal Campus. By using game elements such as points, rankings, and awards, as well as creating user groups to improve interaction among participants and developing a quantitative approach to inhibit spam in opinions, an important result was obtained in a case study conducted with participants of the Computer Science Academic Week. The impact was significant in the groups that used the gamified module, improving user interaction and engagement, thus generating more effective participation in the event and, consequently, an increase in feedback data for the organizers. This increased the average number of submitted opinions by almost 12-fold, without impacting their quality.
