Development of an Application to Aid in the Teaching-Learning Process of Graph Theory.
This work presents the development process of an application to aid in the teaching-learning of the Graph Theory discipline, with the goal of encouraging and facilitating the learning process, using a graphical user interface that adheres to UI/UX standards and can be executed on multiple platforms. The idea is for the student to use it to reinforce the content learned in the classroom and to understand the functioning of algorithms being executed on graphs drawn in the application. Furthermore, the application also shows relevant properties of the graph that can reveal information, helping the student to identify a specific characteristic of a given graph.
