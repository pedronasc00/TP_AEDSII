Predicting Beef Cattle Weights using Computer Vision
Monitoring the weight of beef cattle is extremely important for farmers. This proposal seeks to predict the weight of animals automatically, with an emphasis on extracting information from images, using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In contrast to the conventional method using mechanical scales, the new approach proposes the generation of a data set containing images of cattle, used to train a U-NET model capable of segmenting the animal. The relevant attributes are then extracted and machine learning models are trained to predict the weight of the cattle. The approach was implemented in Python and run on the Google Colab and Google Cloud Virtual Machines platforms. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12.83kg.
