Usability Test of UFV Virtual Labs Simulations with the MEEGA+ Model
Computational tools focused on education enviroment has been studied and used more and more every day, and many studies point that it’s very important that those tools get tested, to guarantee the quality of them. This article aims testing the usability of UFV Virtual Labs’ simulation module, a virtual laboratory of natural sciences and their technologies, by using MEEGA+ method. According to the users responses to a questionnaire, it was possible to analyse the simulations, and the game was classified as a good game according to MEEGA+ scale. However accessibility and operability had worse results than the other dimensions used on the evaluation.
