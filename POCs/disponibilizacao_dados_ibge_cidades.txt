Collection and Provision of IBGE Cidades Data.
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) is the body responsible for the maintenance and provision of statistical data for the entire national territory. However, the unintuitive way in which the data is made available makes its extraction for more elaborate analysis difficult. This article will present a system that enables data extraction in a clearer way. Using concepts from Data Science and other computational resources, the system developed in this work is capable of capturing the data provided by IBGE, formatting it in a more intuitive manner, and storing it in a local database, with the objective of being queried for the creation of graphs and analyses. The data provided by IBGE says a lot about Brazil, how Brazilians live, and how public managers have been spending the nation's resources. From this perspective, the project takes on social characteristics by assisting the population in accessing information in order to question the country's current situation. This article addresses the strategies used for easy assimilation, achieving the objective which is the understanding of the data made available by IBGE.
