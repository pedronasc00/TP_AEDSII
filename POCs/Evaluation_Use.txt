Evaluation of the Use of Transfer Learning for Sentiment Analysis in the MyMobiConf Event Support System
Transfer learning consists of leveraging models related to solving one task to improve the learning of another. It proves to be an important topic as it addresses common problems faced during the construction of machine learning solutions, such as data quality and quantity. The objective of this study was to evaluate how the use of transfer learning techniques could positively or negatively affect the sentiment analysis model present in the MyMobiConf event support system. To do so, the TrAdaBoost algorithm, which aims to perform instance transfer, was implemented, and the behavior of the final generated model was analyzed.The results of the work showed that the use of the selected algorithm can be beneficial, within the presented parameters, when its number of iterations is up to 25, leading to an increase of up to 9% in the model's accuracy.
