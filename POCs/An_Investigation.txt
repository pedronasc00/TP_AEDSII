An Investigation into Using RNN and GNN for App Churn Prediction
Service-providing companies lose a great deal from customer abandonment, which is referred to as "churn" in the literature. Loyalty campaigns offered to all customers can be very costly. Therefore, predicting which customers are likely to churn can be highly advantageous. In this work, the performance of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for churn prediction was evaluated and compared to a traditional Random Forest model and a deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, using only non-sensitive customer data in a digital service churn context. The results indicated that the use of the Graph Neural Network was beneficial: although it achieved the second-best precision (61% vs. 63% for the RNN) and the second-best F1 Macro Score (59.95% vs. 61% for the RNN), it obtained a higher recall for the churn class (68% vs. 61.5% for the baseline and 55% for the RNN). For future work, we intend to extend the concept of using Graph Neural Networks to generic problems defined by event logs, utilizing even more information and model features.
