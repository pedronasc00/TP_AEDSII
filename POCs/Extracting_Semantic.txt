Extracting Semantic Signatures of User Mobility
Human travel routines are an indicator of their preferences and can be represented as a network of locations in spacetime. In this context, studying mobility to understand the behavioral profiles of mobile users is important for creating more effective advertising campaigns, for example. However, few studies utilize large-scale GPS data to define the context of societal mobility. Therefore, this study uses a large volume of GPS data to extract the semantic signature of mobile users' mobility to understand the context of their travel during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that users' mobility patterns changed after restrictions were eased, with the adoption of a hybrid model for work and study.
