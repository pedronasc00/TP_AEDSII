In the last years studies on security solutions to smart homes, transportation systems and even cities have been developed. In this scenario, criminal data have became increasly important. Although occurences from police databases are frequently used, many times the most ordinary crimes end up not being registered by them. The goal of this work is to present a method to extract criminal data from Sao Paulo city portuguese Twitter posts. The majority of related work found perform automatic extractions for english texts. When portuguese is considered, the accurancy is frequently not presented and the final dataset is small. In this work, the final dataset has 1,333 labeled tweets, which were compared to a police database, highlighting information similarities but also possibilities for complementation.
