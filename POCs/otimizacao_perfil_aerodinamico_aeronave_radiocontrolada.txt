Genetic Algorithm applied to the optimization of an airfoil for a radio-controlled aircraft.
The design of a radio-controlled aircraft consists of a series of factors that require meticulous decisions from the designer regarding each part of the aircraft. In many cases, such decisions are directly related to the designer's experience, so the project's success heavily depends on this developer's knowledge. This work proposes the use of a genetic algorithm to optimize a wing's airfoil, with the objective of assisting in aircraft design decisions to maximize the payload carried by the aerial vehicle, considering the rules of the SAE BRASIL AeroDesign competition. The generated data were obtained through the original analytical equation for distance and by an approximate expression generated by genetic programming. As a result, comparisons are made of the values obtained with both the analytical equation and the approximate expression. The results obtained showed satisfactory airfoil configurations capable of carrying masses with values that surpass some well-known airfoils in the literature.
