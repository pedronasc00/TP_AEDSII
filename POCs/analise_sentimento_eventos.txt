Sentiment Analysis of Opinions about Events.
Applications store a growing volume of messages posted by their users, which can reflect their opinions on a given topic. Such a scenario becomes the target of the Sentiment Analysis process, which aims to extract the emotional polarity expressed in a certain textual form in order to obtain relevant knowledge. Starting from this point, this work addresses the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, as well as a supervised machine learning method based on Bayes' Theorem, with the goal of building a model capable of estimating sentiments from user opinions in the MyMobiConf application, considering messages in Portuguese. Its performance is evaluated through metrics specific to this class of algorithms, and the results demonstrate a satisfactory precision for the context in question.
