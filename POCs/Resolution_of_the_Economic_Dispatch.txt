Resolution of the Economic Dispatch Problem with Prohibited Operating Zones using the Bee Algorithm

The optimization of power distribution in thermoelectric power systems is vital, as generation costs are high, making it expensive. The economic dispatch problem aims precisely to solve the problem by modeling a continuous optimization problem, in an attempt to minimize these costs. Aiming for more realism, this work presents a proposal using the Bee Algorithm, called PDEZOPs-BA, to solve the problem with the Prohibited Operating Zones (POZ) variant, which adds discontinuity to the economic dispatch problem. This work presents results obtained through case studies based on the economic dispatch problem with POZs, with the purpose of validating the PDEZOPs-BA.
