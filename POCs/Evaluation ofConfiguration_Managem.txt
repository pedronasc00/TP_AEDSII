Evaluation of Configuration Management Process Maturity in Open Source Projects

With the increasing number of contributors and companies in open source projects, it is necessary to study the maturity of the adopted development processes. This paper proposes quantitative metrics, based on the CMMI, MPS.BR, and OMM models, to evaluate the maturity of Software Configuration Management (SCG) processes in open source projects. The metrics were automated and applied to data from 6 projects hosted on GitHub. The results were unsatisfactory in terms of SCG best practices. Furthermore, for all projects, some gaps were found in terms of the change control flow and the traceability of release configuration items.
