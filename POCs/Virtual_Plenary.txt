Virtual Plenary - A Comparative Political Ideology System for Municipal Legislative Candidates in Belo Horizonte
This article presents a web-based system that simulates a Virtual Plenary to compare the political ideologies of candidates for municipal legislative positions. The objective is to provide an interactive platform where users can participate in a virtual plenary session and, at the end, compare their choices on bills with those of elected council members. Ultimately, the comparison between the user's choices and those of the council members provides a comparative assessment of their political ideology. The system includes a user-friendly interface, data collection and processing mechanisms, and uses the PCA algorithm in constructing the comparative analysis. The system's effectiveness and usability were evaluated through tests conducted with real users.
